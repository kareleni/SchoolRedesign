        <h3> Luke Glaser came to Hazard four years ago, in 2013. He came through a program known as, "Teach for America". When Mr.Glaser first started teaching at Hazard High School, he was a spanish teacher. As the years went by, he started teaching the subject that he truly loves, math! Not just any math classes, but pre-calculus and calculus. He now spends his days helping the students become brighter and better.

        <h3> Chelsea Duff is a new member of our staff, but she is not a new member of our bulldog family. She attended Hazard High School as a teenager and from that point on she knew her heart was at Hazard. Unfortunately, she taught at Perry Central before teaching the chemistry classes here. But through this time, she always had bulldog pride!!</h3>
